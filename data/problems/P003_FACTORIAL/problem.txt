DESCRIPTION:
Write a program that calculates the factorial of a given non-negative integer.

The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.
For example, factorial of 5 is 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120

Input: A single non-negative integer N
Output: Print the factorial of N

Constraints:
- 0 <= N <= 12

Note: 0! = 1 by definition
