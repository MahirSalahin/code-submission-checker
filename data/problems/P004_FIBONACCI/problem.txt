DESCRIPTION:
Write a program that prints the first N numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.

The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:
- F(0) = 0
- F(1) = 1
- F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1

Input: A positive integer N
Output: Print the first N Fibonacci numbers, separated by spaces

Constraints:
- 1 <= N <= 20

TEST_CASES:
test1.in -> test1.out
test2.in -> test2.out
test3.in -> test3.out
